# üî¢ Raspberry Pi 4-bit ALU with I2C LCD & GPIO Buttons

This project demonstrates a low-level binary calculator built using a **Raspberry Pi**, **I2C LCD display**, and **7 GPIO buttons**, emulating basic ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) operations in real-time.

## üìå Features

- ‚úÖ Input 4-bit binary numbers using toggle buttons
- ‚úÖ Real-time binary + decimal preview on LCD
- ‚úÖ Choose operation: `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR` via navigation buttons
- ‚úÖ View result in `Binary`, `Octal`, or `Hex` (with Decimal shown alongside)
- ‚úÖ Designed for educational use: demonstrates how basic binary operations work at the bit level

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Stage
- The user sets 4 bits (A and B) using 4 dedicated toggle buttons.
- Bit state is displayed on the LCD in real-time as binary and decimal.
- Pressing the **Enter** button locks in the input.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Operation Selection
- The user navigates through `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR` using **Left** and **Right** buttons.
- The **Enter** button confirms the selected operation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Format Selection
- The user chooses how the result is displayed:
  - **BIN**: Binary (with decimal shown)
  - **OCT**: Octal (with decimal shown)
  - **HEX**: Hexadecimal (with decimal shown)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Result Display
- The selected operation is performed.
- Result is shown for 10 seconds on the LCD in the selected format **+ decimal** (e.g., `0x15 = 21`).

## üí° Bit-Level Logic

- Each button press toggles a bit between 0 and 1.
- Operations are done in **5-bit logic** to support overflow results (e.g., `15 + 15 = 30`).
- Subtraction wraps using:  
  ```python
  result = (a - b) % 32
